# Classify-Iris-Flowers

This project: classifying Iris flowers using various machine learning techniques. I classified the dataset based on their Sepal and Petal dimensions.

Using the renowned Iris dataset, I explored different machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression. 

Leveraging the power of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, I preprocessed the data and built a robust model pipeline.

To evaluate the performance of the model, I divided the dataset into training and testing subsets using the sklearn library, ensuring unbiased assessment. Through meticulous training and fine-tuning, I achieved an impressive accuracy of over 95%.

This project not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a deeper understanding of data manipulation, model evaluation, and the importance of experimentation in machine learning.
